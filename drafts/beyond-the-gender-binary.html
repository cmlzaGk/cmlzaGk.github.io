            <p>“Beyond the gender binary” is a pocketbook by Alok Vaid-Menon. </p>
<p>It is a short, single-chapter, 65 page book, and took a little over an hour for me to complete. </p>
<p>I was encouraged to read the book by a colleague to develop awareness of the LGBTQIA+ community and learn off their daily experiences. </p>
<p>The first half of the book speaks about the author’s evolution and experience as a gender non-conforming trans feminine. </p>
<p>The second half addresses arguments against gender non-conforming people.</p>

<h2>Structure And Style</h2>
<p>The book points out that for many things, we focus on the topic (gender fluidity), without ever focusing on experiences of people living it. </p>
<p>The first half attempts to bridge the gap by sharing the experience of the author. </p>
<p>It questions the power structure of the society and institutions, and do they really encourage people to be different, or only different to a point where it allows them to place people in boxes without making things uncomfortable for the institutions.  </p>
<p>The second half of the book addresses common talking-points against gender non-conforming people. </p>
<p>This part of the book is well structured. </p>
<p>The arguments are categorized into four categories – Dismissal, Inconvenience, Biology and Slippery Slope. </p>
<p>The author creates a sub-topic from a talking point and provides their analysis of the sub-topic, where it originates from and why they think its flawed.</p>
<p>The book is very easy to read, clear, concise and to the point. </p>
<p>The narrative is relatable, with author occasionally putting a humorous and witty twist to keep the reader engaged.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The book is thought provoking. While the conversation is about gender non-conforming people, a lot of discussion also applies to a broader spectrum of the society.</p>
<p>Given the short nature of the book, it was a perfect first book to begin a journey to learn about LGBTQIA+ for me. </p>
